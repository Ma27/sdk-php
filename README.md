## This is the privacyIDEA-PHP-SDK

This library will help you to connect your Plugin to the privacyIDEA server using REST APIs.

## Requirements

To do it with Composer simply copy that line to your Terminal in your project directory:

`composer require curl/curl`

Remember that you have to install Composer first. If you will know how to install Composer, check this documentation:
