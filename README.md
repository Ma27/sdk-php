##This is the privacyIDEA-PHP-SDK.

This library will help you to connect your plugin to the privacyIDEA server using REST APIs.

##Requirements

To use our API library you have to install curl on your machine or add curl/curl using Composer. 
To do it with Composer simply copy that line to your terminal in your project directory:

`composer require curl/curl`

Remember that you have to install composer first. If you will know how to do it, check this documentation:
https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md
